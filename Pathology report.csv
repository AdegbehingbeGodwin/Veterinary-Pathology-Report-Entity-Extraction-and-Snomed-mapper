Title,Report
Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome in Horse,"On 22 September 1994 an emergency situation was recognised at a Hendra stables in Brisbane. Onset of
severe illness in 8-9 horses had occurred on 19 September 1994. Signs observed were depression, anorexia,
weakness, high fever of 40 to 41 and severe respiratory difficulty in later stages with frothy discharge from
the nose terminally. Eleven animals were euthanased or died naturally between 20 September 1994 and 26
September 1994. One animal in an adjacent neighbouring stable was euthanased after showing signs of
severe illness for only several hours. Another animal which had left the stables on 16 September 1994 died
on a Kenilworth property after showing similar signs. The index case was suspected to be a mare which
entered the stables from a spelling paddock at Cannon Hill on 7 September 1994. This animal died on 9
September 1994 after showing severe respiratory difficulty and terminal frothy discharge from the nose.
The consistent necropsy findings in all animals were cyanosis and petechiation of the buccal mucosa, stable
froth in the trachea and bronchi and severe congestion and oedema of the lungs with multiple focal
haemorrhages on the pleural and cut surfaces. The cut surface of the lung exuded copious blood stained
fluid. Some animals showed mild to moderate jaundice, petechiation of the peritoneum and epicardial
haemorrhage. One horse showed petechiation of the gastric mucosa.
Histologically, lung was congested and had large focal or extensive haemorrhages which were frequently
associated with fibrin thrombi in capillaries and arterioles. Oedema was extensive in ventral lung sections
and alveolar lesions were larger, more advanced lesions showed alveolar necrosis and fibrinous alveolar
exudate containing some neutrophils. As the lesion progressed a cellular exudate consisting of macrophages
occurred as well as small foci of hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes. Multinucleate
syncytia were present in the alveoli in some lung sections in both peracute haemorrhagic and later stages.
Multinucleate or polymorphonuclear cells with little cytoplasm were numerous in arterioles and capillaries
in some early lesions. These resembled megakaryocytes but in arterioles they appeared to be derived from
endothelium. Possible eosinophilic intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions were seen very rarely in a
few macrophages and septal cells. The lung lesion was interpreted as a peracute or acute interstitial
pneumonia which was associated with intravascular coagulation in arterioles and alveolar capillaries.
A paramyxovirus causing prominent CPE with syncytium formation in equine dermal cells and other cell
lines has been isolated from lung specimens of 5 of 6 animals sampled at necropsy. Antibodies to this virus
have been demonstrated in several horses which recovered. Transmission of lung material an of cell culture
isolate at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory, Geelong has reproduced an acute fatal respiratory
disease in horses and confirmed that the virus is the cause of the condition. Further Morphological
characterisation at AAHL has demonstrated that the virus is a morbillivirus (measles, distemper, rinderpest
group) but no relation ship to known morbilliviruses has been shown as yet.
Serological survey of horses in Queensland has so far demonstrated no positive animals outside the three
infected sites. Several cases of human infection have been verified serologically including the trainer Vic
Rail who died with an acute lung disease."
Idiopathic Heart Failure/Liver Necrosis Syndrome in pigs,"Grower pigs on a Beaudesert piggery began suffering from dyspnoea and sudden death during November
1993. Only that group which had suffered an incident of nutritionally induced diarrhoea later developed the
syndrome. Necropsy findings were dominated by dilation of the heart, excessive volumes of fluid in body
cavities and swollen congested liver (chronic venous congestion). Pulmonary oedema and extensive
pneumonia was present in some but not all affected pigs. Histologically there was extensive centrilobular,
in some cases almost panlobular hepatocyte loss with variable replacement haemorrhage (anoxia induced?)
in livers. Lungs frequently showed severe interstitial pneumonia and oedema. No significant
histopathological lesions were seen in the heart muscle. The cause of the syndrome is presently unresolved.
The scouring which preceded this syndrome occurred in weaners (4-10 weeks) held in 2 pens adjacent to
the farrowing shed. A nutritionally dense diet high in energy and protein and comprised of canola meal,
full-fat soya meal, fish meal and vegetable oil was considered the cause of the scour. A low specification
feed was introduced and also (a week later) medication of the feed with lincomycin (44g/ton) and neomycin
(300g/ton) was carried out for a week. Canola meal still comprised 25% of the ration. The scouring ceased
but 2 weeks later the sudden deaths commenced. At this time the pigs had been shifted from the weaner
pens to the nearby grower shed consisting of pens with solid walls on each side of a central walkway.
Excreta was collected beneath the pens and removed, draining (without flushing) every 2-3 days. Pigs died
at the rate of 1-2 per day and a total of 63 pigs died in the 2 month period to 10-1-94.
Biochemical estimations on samples from 10 pigs of the affected group were carried out. Serum vitamin E
and blood glutathione peroxidase levels were normal; serum iron was low in 2 pigs, 299 and 704 ug/L (ref
730-1400) and serum copper was high in 6 pigs, 1347 to 1726 ug/L (ref 800-1200). Further biochemistry
was done on tissue samples from 3 pigs with typical liver and heart lesions. Liver and kidney selenium
levels were normal; liver copper was low in 2 pigs, 11.4 and 6.7 ppm (ref >15) but kidney copper levels
were normal. Hydrogen sulphide poisoning from the effluent pit, blue green algae toxicity from the
drinking water (an on-site dam) and plant seed toxicity including pyrrolizidine alkaloids were also
considered but not implicated in the disease syndrome."
Avian pulmonary tuberculosis in broiler breeders,"Avian pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed histologically in a fixed lung specimen submitted from one of
a flock of male broiler breeders in the Lockyer district in mid December 1993. Acid-fast bacilli were
present in moderate numbers in the multiple small caseous granulomas in lung tissue. Thirty of 500 birds
had died in a flock of 30-week-old birds. Clinical signs described were anorexia, lethargy and loss of
weight. Diarrhoea was also seen in this flock, but the connection with the tuberculosis was uncertain. The
flock was receiving chlortetracycline medication. Further samples from the flock for laboratory study have
had no gross or histological lesions of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis in poultry caused by Mycobacterium
avium serotypes 1 or 2 is typically seen as intestinal, liver and spleen lesions. These lesions have not been
reported from the flock in question. It appears possible that the unidentified acid-fast bacilli seen in the
lung lesions were an opportunistic pathogen of environmental origin"
Tail Rot in Eels,"Heavy losses occurred in eels (Anguilla reinhardti) in a holding tank on Reddacliff Peninsula after harvest
at Bjelke Petersen Dam and transport to Brisbane. Losses commenced 4 days after introduction and by day
7 about 200kg of a total of 400kg had died. Severe tail erosion with extensive skin ulceration progressing
forward on both sides was seen in 5 eels (length 72-132cm) examined at the laboratory. A thin translucent
membrane which readily peeled off was present on affected skin areas. This was seen to be composed of a
mat of fungal hyphae consistent with Saprolegnia sp on histological examination. Internal organs and gills
were not affected on gross and microscopic examination and bacterial cultures of skin and kidney resulted
4.
in isolates of Aeromonas hydrophila from skin only. The diagnosis made was tail rot due to Seprolegnia sp
and Aeromonas hydrophila and this was considered secondary to stress caused by capture, transport, high
stocking density and water quality problems."
Crotalaria dissitiflora (pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis) in horses,"Typical pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis was seen in 4 stock horses grazing Mitchell grass downs containing a
large population of Crotalaria dissitiflora (grey rattlepod) near Richmond in mid-February 1994. All 4
horses died or were killed humanely. The last recorded case of horses with pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis
associated with this Crotalaria species was in 1947 by C. T. White, then Government Botanist. Plant
specimens from the current case were placed in the Queensland Herbarium as vouchers (AQ623846;
AQ624771). Curiously, the test for pyrrolic metabolites on the liver of one horse with typical lesions was
negative."
Nitrate-nitrite poisoning from button grass in cattle,"Nitrate-nitrite poisoning was diagnosed in a group of 152 1-2 year old Brahman steers trucked from
Charters Towers, dipped in Barricade S at Maxwelton on 10 May, trucked to a property outside Maxwelton
and placed into cattle yards full of dried-off button grass. On the morning of 11 May, 5 were found dead
and a further 6 were sick of which 2 died within a few hours. Necropsy revealed dark brown discolouration
of the blood. An aqueous humour sample from one dead steer contained 75mg nitrate/L (normal ca
5mg/L). A sample of the remaining button grass (Dactyloctenium radulans) contained 4.8% KNO3 in dry
matter. Concentrations over 1.5% KNO3 are hazardous to ruminants. The important point about this case is
that even dried-off button grass is a high-soil-nitrate situation, such as cattle yards is a serious hazard to
stock."
Oleander poisoning in cattle,"Poisoning by oleander (Nerium oleander) was diagnosed in a group of 50 20-month-old Santa Gertrudis-
cross weaners introduced 5 days previously to a property at Nanango in early June 1994. The group had
access to oleander trees in a house yard and the pasture available was of poor quality. Severe dysentery
was observed. Five animals died. Necropsy of one animal that died over 24 hours after onset of illness
revealed haemorrhage and congestion in the large intestine, cyanosis and ecchymoses over an enlarged
heart. Oleander leaves were recognised in the rumen. Multiple scattered foci of degeneration and necrosis
were seen in cardiac muscle submitted for histopathology."
Cardiomyopathy and Atrial Thrombosis in a Foal,"Clinical examination of a 6-months old thoroughbred foal indicated loss of condition, depression,
recumbency and exaggerated heart sounds.
The most prominent post gross autopsy finding was hydropericardium. On histopathological examination
of the right ventricular myocardium and atria, there were multifocal areas of myocardial degeneration.
Associated with the atrial endocardium there was fibrin and platelet thrombus formation with evidence of
early organisation.
These changes lead to a diagnosis of cardiomyopathy with atrial thrombosis occurring secondarily to
disordered myocardial contractility of some duration.
Aetiological suggestions centred on the possibility of a congenital cardiomyopathy of an acquired
condition, possibly associated with a selenium/vitamin E responsive syndrome."
Herpes virus pneumonia in a feedlot steer,"Portions of lung from a feedlot steer with laboured breathing showed extensive grey consolidation with
pale bronchogenic patterns. Microscopically there was a necrotising bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia
with prominent hyperplasia of Type II pneumocytes to give alveoli an epithelialised or pseudoglandular
appearance. There was abundant accumulation of neutrophils within airways and alveoli. Numerous
intranuclear eosinophilic inclusion bodies typical of herpesvirus were found in airway and alveolar
epithelium.
These changes are typical of those associated with the more severe respiratory manifestations of bovine
herpes virus, Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) infection which is common in feedlots in North
America and being encountered with increasing frequency in Australian feedlots."
Dermatophyte infection as a cause of Pyogranulomatous Dermatitis in a Cat,"Microsporum canis was cultured from chronic suppurative cutaneous lesions in the lumbosacral area of a
cat which has persisted for more than a year. The provisional diagnosis was cutaneous mycobacteriosis.
Histopathologically there was a severe deep dermal inflammatory reaction characterised by a multifocal
and coalescing granulomatous response to numerous, relatively large club colony formations of non-
pigmented yeast and hyphal forms of a fungus with the microns in diameter. Focal aggregations of foamy
macrophages were a feature of the granulomatous response. There was sinus tract formation with ulceration
of the overlying epidermis to give the lesion characteristics of a mycetoma."
"Cutaneous Nodular Dermatofibrosis of German Shepherds associated with Renal Cystic disease and
Neoplasia","Several cases of nodular dermatofibrosis (a recently described reputedly rare syndrome in German
Shepherds) have recently been diagnosed by VPS.
This syndrome presents clinically as multiple firm well circumscribed dermal and subcutaneous nodules
varying from several millimetres to 4cm in diameter. The overlying skin may show irregular thickening and
hyperpigmentation, and larger lesions are often alopecic and ulcerated.
The lesions are found primarily on the limbs, head and ears, usually middle aged or older.
The skin lesions are of particular interest because they may act as a marker for an internal malignancy,
specifically renal cystadenocarcinoma. A metastatic tumour of this type has been confirmed histologically
in a Sydney German Shepherd dog affected with dermatofibrosis.
Also, in keeping with overseas findings, non-neoplastic renal cystic disease has also been associated with
this condition in some of our cases.
The disease is reported to have a dominant mode of inheritance and overseas has been seen in cross bred
dogs with German Shepherd parentage. The relationship of the skin lesions in the development of renal
neoplasms is not understood, but in humans, several familiar syndromes of multiple cutaneous tumours
associated with specific internal malignancies exist. Cutaneous nodular dermatofibrosis is the first such
entity to be documented in animals."
Chlamydiosis in an Ostrich,"Chlamydial infection has received little attention as a potential disease problem in Australian ostriches, but
the recent finding at VPS of a positive chlamydial antigen rest on a nasal swab from a 12 months old
ostrich with catarrhal rhinitis and sinusitis may indicate the desirability of closer surveillance for this
disease. The bird was serologically negative for Aspergillus sp infection."
Catastrophic ILT mortality in chickens,"Tissues for histopathological examination were received following an investigation of the deaths of 130 of
a group of 140 bantam chickens which had dyspnoea as the salient clinical finding.
On histopathology, there was a severe diphtheritic tracheitis with formation of a necrotic exudative cast
containing exfoliated tracheal epithelial cells, many of which contained intranuclear inclusion bodies. The
tracheal mucosa was haemorrhagic, ulcerated and had mixed leucocytic infiltration. Numerous bacterial
colonies were also present in the cast. Similar changes were evident in larger airways in the lung.
A diagnosis of ILT (Infectious Laryngotracheitis) was made on the basis of the distinctive necrotising and
inflammatory changes in the trachea and typical herpes virus-type inclusion bodies.
This disease outbreak illustrates the catastrophic nature of the mortalities which can be associated with
infection of a virulent strain of ILT virus. In this case there was perivascular mononuclear cuffing in the
brain and heart reminiscent of that which may occur in fowl plague and avian influenza, possibilities which
are being investigated by the relevant authorities."
Larval Cyathostomiasis in Horses,"Several properties in the Adelaide area reported cases of chronic progressive weight loss in horses during
July and August of 1994.
The affected animals ranged in age from yearling to 3 years. The major presenting signs were weight loss,
with or without diarrhoea, anorexia and periodic elevation in body temperature.
Consistent findings were hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia with severe hyponatraemia and
hypochloridaemia. Haemograms revealed low grade anaemia, leucocytosis with relative neutrophilia, high
fibrogen levels and, in some cases mild eosinophilia. Faecal floatations were negative and faecal cultures
did not yield significant pathogens. There was variable response to treatment with drenches, antibiotics
and steroids. However, the missing piece of the puzzle was found when one animal began excreting very
large numbers of small strongyle larvae in the faeces.
Small strongyles (cyathostomes) are ordinarily considered of little pathologic significance, particularly in
the adult form in the large intestine. The larval stages migrate into the intestinal mucosa and submucosa for
development, usually causing a moderate inflammatory reaction. However, in horses which have been
heavily infected in the previous year, a massive emergence of larvae during late winter and early spring can
cause profuse diarrhoea, ventral oedema and severe weight loss.
When the larvae are in the mucosa, faecal egg counts are usually negative. Once they emerge into the
lumen, treatment with febendazole or invermectin can be helpful. Management procedures, including
grazing horses with cattle, can help reduce the exposure of the horses to large burdens of larvae."
Gastric Botryomycosis in a Rhodesian Ridgeback,"A 15 month old Rhodesian Ridgeback dog was submitted to a local veterinary clinic with a history of
weight loss, vomition of bile and occasional melena. The dog was still eating and was bright and alert on
clinical examination. A range of biochemistry and a full blood count was done. Significant changes are
listed below:
Reference ranges
Total protein g/L 106 55-81
Globulin g/L 80 23-50
Eosinophils X 109 1.0 0.1-0.5
The elevated globulin indicated an antigenic response, with the eosinophilia suggesting hypersensitivity or
necrosis. On laparotomy multiple firm white nodules were found in the wall of the stomach and scattered
along mesentery and intestinal serosa. The dog was euthanased.
Histopathology revealed marked proliferation of dense connective tissue in the gastric submucosa with
granulomas composed of eosinophils, macrophages and lymphocytes scattered throughout the stomach
wall. In the centre of the granulomas were ""sulfur granules"" containing Gram positive cocci. The muscle
layers were hypertrophied.
9.
""Botryomycosis"" due to persistent low grade infection with Staphylococcus aureus has been reported in
horses and pigs. It is usually associated with skin wounds on the neck and pectoral region in the horse; and
castration wounds and mammary lesions in the pig. Dissemination to the lymph nodes and viscera has been
described in some early reports in the literature.
There were no obvious skin lesions in this dog at the time of presentation and no record of ingestion of a
foreign body. However, such portals of entry would need to be considered in a possible pathogenesis,
particularly in a young active puppy. I have been unable to find any descriptions of this condition in dogs in
the literature to date."
Balanitis in Border Leicester rams,"Balanitis was observed in 70% of 35 Border Leicester rams following an 8-week period of joining.
Bacterial and viral cultures were unrewarding and 3 serums gave negative reactions in viral neutralisation
tests for herpes viruses - the caprine and bovine varieties. Severe, subacute, segmental, necrotising and
ulcerative balanoposthitis was found histologically. Exudation was fibrinohaemorrhagic and the underlying
inflammatory response was dominated by plasma cells."
Toxoplasmosis in ewes,"Toxoplasmosis was diagnosed as the cause of late term abortion in 15 of 320 Crossbred ewes. Microscopic
lesions included multifocal leukoencephalomalacia, mild multifocal non-suppurative encephalitis and non-
suppurative placentitis associated with numerous Toxoplasma gondii.

Pasteurella haemolytica Type T caused bacteraemia in weaner sheep.
Associated histopathological lesions included acute multifocal necrotic hepatitis, sub-acute multifocal
suppurative embolic pneumonia and acute segmental fibrinous pleuritis"
Malignant Catarrhal fever in cattle,"Malignant catarrhal fever was diagnosed in 2 of 25 Angus cattle. Depression, pyrexia, dyspnoea, bilateral
nasal discharge and opacity of the sclerocorneal junction were observed clinically. The pathognomonic
non-suppurative and fibrinoid vasculitis was found histologically in portal triads, brain, leptomeninges, oral
mucosa, oesophagus and lymph nodes. In the more acute of the two cases, moderate, acute, multifocal
necrotising lymphadenitis was an additional observation."
Coccidiosis in wombat and kangaroo,"Coccidiosis caused disease in a 14-month-old male wombat and a 16-month-old female Eastern Grey
kangaroo. The former had numerous very large oocysts, schizonts and macrogametocytes within the
lacteals of the ileum. Eimeria (Globidium) tasmania is the most likely aetiological candidate. Eimeria
kogoni was the possible cause in the latter. The kangaroo also had evidence of a disseminated T. gondii
infection in the form of moderate to severe, chronic, multifocal, non-suppurative myositis and interstitial
myocarditis. Lesser non-suppurative inflammation was also noted in the intestinal tunica muscularis, portal
triads, lungs, kidneys and thyroid gland."
Dermatophytosis in cats,"Dermatophytosis was associated with interesting pathological changes in two cats.
Material for histological examination, only, was submitted from the first case, which was a 4.5 year-old
speyed Domestic Long Hair. It had severe chronic granulomatous peritonitis associated with prominent
mycetomas. A mycetoma was found in the hypodermis of one skin section , along with mild hyperplastic
dermatitis and numerous fungal hyphae and spores in the superficial epidermis. The Department of
Microbiology at the Royal North Shore Hospital placed Pseudallescheria boydii “at the top of the list of
suspects” for the peritoneal fungi. Microsporum canis was recovered from lesions of severe chronic
granulomatous lymphadenitis and chronic granulomatous nodular dermatitis in a 4.5 year-old male Persian"
Ectopia cordis in a calf ,"A neonate Angus-cross calf which had died 1½ hours after birth was presented to the laboratory. The heart
was globose and displaced ventrally outside the body through an 8cm long by 2cm wide defect in the
sternum. Developmental abnormalities in the heart included:
* an atrial septal defect (3cm diameter foramen ovale)
* dilation of the right ventricle with thickening of interventricular septum and right ventricular wall.
The dorsal and ventral surfaces of the cusps of the tricuspid valve were thickened, red and granular
with tangles of red thrombi extending over the cusp surfaces and around the corda tendinae.
* There were three circular interventricular septal defects 5 to 10mm in diameter; one in the
craniodorsal septum under the anterior of the a/v valve adjacent and caudal to the pulmonary
outflow; the other two were near the ventricular apex.
12.
* the aorta was completely transposed to the right of and anterior to the conus arteriosus. The aortic
trunk exited in front of the pulmonary artery and extended as a 14cm long vessel to the dorsal
thorax where it branched to form the brachiocephalic trunk and descending aorta.
* Left ventricular hypoplasia (50mm deep, 40mm wide). It had a narrow a/v opening (15mm in
diameter) and drained to the right ventricle through the three interventricular septal defects.
It is interesting that the calf survived for 1½ hours after birth, considering the severity of the abnormality."
Rhabdomyosarcoma in a koala,"An adult female koala had haemathorax with collapse of the right lung and left displacement of the thoracic
organs. The source of the haemorrhage was a solid pale grey multinodular tumour - 2cm x 3cm in right
dorsal diaphragm, adjacent to the costal wall. It infiltrated lumbar muscles. The tumour was composed of
whorls and fascicles of closely packed plump, round to fusiform cells with even eosinophilic cytoplasm and
a single nucleus. Multinucleated giant cells were evident in several areas through the tumour. Cross
striations were not evident in these cells when stained by PTAH: whether the freeze/thaw affected this
result is unknown. However, the site of the tumour and its pleomorphism is consistent with
rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcomas are very unusual tumours in koalas; we are unaware of any
previous records of rhabdomyosarcoma in koalas."
Fatal anaphylaxis in a kitten,"A 4-month-old kitten was found dead in the early morning after being apparently normal the night before.
At necropsy the lungs were diffusely dark red and on histological examination there was marked
congestion, thick proteinaceous fluid in many alveoli and larger airways, dilation of pulmonary lymphatic
vessels, and a moderate increase in alveolar macrophages; no haemosiderin was seen. Dilation of lymphatic
vessels was also seen histologically around the mesenteric lymph node. Sections of liver, intestine, kidney,
spleen and brain were normal.
The thickness of the alveolar fluid seen here suggested a substantial increase in capillary permeability. This
is in contrast to the more familiar low protein pulmonary oedema fluid commonly seen with congestive
heart failure. On further discussion with the owner, it was learned that there was a bee hive on the
neighbour's property. It was felt, therefore, that the kitten had suffered a type I hypersensitivity reaction to a
bee sting, presumably following sensitisation from previous stings, and that death was due to the ensuing
exudative response possibly accompanied by bronchospasm. While the main organ manifesting anaphylaxis
in the cat is said to be the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract can also be involved; this can cause vomiting,
although this does not appear to have occurred here because the stomach was still full."
Castration-responsive dermatosis,"A 6-year-old male Keeshond had been developing symmetrical alopecia and hyperpigmentation over the
back and ventrum for 18 months; four skin biopsies were submitted. The most striking changes were
hyperpigmentation of the basal layer of the epidermis, diffuse pigmentation of all other epidermal layers,
follicular hyperkeratosis, and the presence of numerous 'flame follicles' (follicles in which bright orange
spikes of keratin radiate from the centre through the outer root sheath). Other changes included slight
acanthosis, moderate hyperkeratosis, and dilation of the apocrine sweat glands; all hair follicles were in
telogen.Individually, these changes can be seen in a range of endocrinopathies and other 'atrophic' skin diseases.
However, the breed, history, prominence of flame follicles and finely granular (as opposed to clumped)
melanin led to a tentative diagnosis of castration-responsive dermatosis. This is a condition to which the
Spitz-type breeds are predisposed; it is also referred to as adult-onset growth hormone-responsive
dermatosis. This dog was castrated and within a few weeks, extensive regrowth of hair had occurred, much
to the owner's delight."
Cerebellar abiotrophy in laboratory mice,"Occasional mice in a colony of C57BL/6 mice homozygous for the severe combined immunodeficiency
(scid) gene were seen to display a continuous rapid fine motor tremor (possible intention tremor), ataxia
and a tendency to fall to one side. They were in good body condition and had been shown to be fertile. On
necropsy the cerebellum was found to be about 2/3 normal diameter; histological examination revealed
thinning of the cerebellar molecular layer, at least a 50% reduction in the number of Purkinje cells, and
occasional shrunken, markedly basophilic Purkinje cells.
Several mutations are described in mice in which cerebellar abnormalities are a major finding; these are
given descriptive names such as lurcher, reeler, teetering, jolting and vibrator. It is uncertain at this stage
whether the condition in these mice is a previously undescribed mutation."
Multifocal hepatic necrosis - Poultry,"There was a sudden increase in mortalities and decrease in production in a 26 week old layer flock near
Tamworth. Birds appeared febrile and often died quickly and quietly. There was a good response to
antibiotics but the problem recurred when treatment stopped.
The typical gross lesions were multiple whitish foci of varying size, 1 to 5mm in diameter throughout the
liver. Some birds had petechial haemorrhages in some visceral organs.
On histopathology the significant lesion was found in the liver and consisted of acute multifocal hepatic
necrosis infiltrated by low to moderate number of heterophils and macrophages. Some of these foci were
progressing to form granulomas. In other places in the liver there were small foci of coagulative necrosis of
hepatocytes with no or very little inflammatory cell response.
Routine bacteriologic examination of the livers was negative.
The findings suggested a bacterial aetiology and more livers were cultured using selective media for
Salmonella, and selective media and microaerophilic atmosphere for Campylobacter without success.
Silver and gram stains of liver sections were also negative.
The aetiology is not known although avian spirochetosis is suspected because the shed was infested with
Argas persicus."
Visceral larva migrans - Pig,"Formalin fixed tissues were submitted from a 13 week old piglet which was euthanased following ill thrift
and inco-ordination affecting all four limbs. At post mortem there were large numbers of Ascaris worms in
the small intestine. Histologic examination of the spinal cord revealed extensive multifocal haemorrhages
in the ventral horn of the grey matter, surrounded by macrophages and a few eosinophils. Many large
neurons were necrotic. In the white matter there was axonal swelling and Wallerian degeneration especially
14.
in areas close to the grey matter. In the liver there were multifocal granulomas with eosinophils. Lung was
not submitted.
A diagnosis of possible ""visceral larva migrans"" was made.
Internal parasitism caused by Ascaris suis is rarely seen today. The ingested eggs hatch in the intestine,
larvae reach the liver through the hepatoportal blood stream, and are carried by the blood to the lungs. Most
of the larvae are arrested in the capillaries in the lungs but some may pass through into the arterial
circulation and reach other organs where extensive migration may occur.
The piggery is semi-intensive, sows farrow in the paddock and weaners are brought into the shed at 6
weeks. Deaths have occurred sporadically since weaning; clinical signs included lethargy and progressive
weight loss over a number of weeks. The weaners were drenched several times with Nilverm. Re-
infestation, faulty drenching or drench resistance is being investigated."
"Drought, Metabolic Diseases and Plant Poisonings ","According to the August 1994 Weather Review for Armidale (compiled by Peter Burr, UNE), the winter
total of 57mm of rain was the lowest since the last major drought in 1982 when only 27mm was recorded
for the three months. The clear skies and lighter than usual winds resulted in warmer than normal day
temperatures and very cold overnight minimums, with minus 10.2°C being recorded one day in East
Armidale.
Predictably the weather conditions pedisposed pregnant and post-partum ewes and cows to metabolic
diseases such as pregnancy toxaemia (with losses up to 10% in some flocks) and hypocalcaemia and this
was reflected in submissions to the lab.
There have been reports of small losses due to enterotoxaemia in sheep on grain diets, especially in lot
feeding situations. Grain poisoning has also been encountered. In one case, sheep on one brand of pellet
suffered severe acidosis when a new batch was used. Sixteen died and up to 30% were sick out of a mob of
1200 ewes.
The drought has also resulted in more submissions and enquiries relating to plant poisoning, particularly in
the north west slopes and plains of NSW. Shaun Slattery, District Veterinarian at Narrabri, has seen a
number of cases of ""Mother of Millions"" (Bryophylum sp) in cattle and also suspected Quinine Bush
poisoning. There have been reports of rock fern poisoning in cattle also. Bill Hetherington (DV Moree) has
had his share of suspected plant poisonings as well. One case (AN94.3023.SL) involved 12 deaths in a
mob of 170 cattle at Gravesend on drought affected ""pasture"". Tree Tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) was the
main suspect and the cattle had been eating this as well as a variety of other plants, including Narrow Leaf
Cotton Bush (Gomphocarpus fruticosus). In South Africa, ostriches are reportedly the animal most
commonly poisoned by N glauca.
Of interest also have been cases of suspected ""Agave"" poisoning in cattle."
Suspected Agave Poisoning in Cattle,"We have had two cases of suspected Agave americana poisoning recently.
Peter Gough, private practitioner at Moree, rang the lab in August to discuss suspected Agave toxicity in
cattle on a property at Bellata. Four out of 13 Hereford cows in a particular paddock were first affected in
July. There was little feed and the cattle had clearly spent some time eating an Agave plant in the paddock.
Peter describes the hind limbs as being affected, the appearance being not unlike that of obturator paralysis
in 3 post-partum cow. The feet are flat on the ground but the pastern and the fetlock are further forward
15.
than normal. Of the 4 affected cows, two have completely recovered, one still walks with an abnormal hind
limb gait and the fourth is still down. This fourth cow is quite bright in demeanour, has no pressure sores,
and can half raise herself from the ground using her forelegs.
The second case occurred early in September and was investigated by Barraba veterinarian Lee Morris and
handled by Bob Coverdale at the lab (AN94.3452.ORC). Five to ten out of 23 Hereford cows on a Barraba
property were affected. There was no green feed available and some obviously had been eating Agave. Lee
describes the affected animals as being bright and walking on the hind toes with contracted fetlocks. Urine
was submitted from one animal and blood from three. Urinalysis and the haemograms were unremarkable.
Ca, Mg, P, creatinine, AST, CPK, GLDH, and AP estimates were done on the 3 serums. CPK’s were 1322,
271 and 916 (reference range: <200 U/L). Other analytes were unremarkable apart from marginally
elevated AST and GLDH in the animal with a CK of 916 U/L.
Everist tells us that the Avavaceae family has more than 650 species, mostly tropical or subtropical in
origin. One species of Agave has been reported as poisonous to livestock in North America (presumably A.
lechequilla, referred to by the Merck Veterinary Manual (MVM)) but this plant is not known to occur in
Australia. Several species are common garden plants in this country and two (Agave Americana, Century
Plant, and A. sisalina, Sisal) are semi-naturalised, the first in tropical and subtropical inland areas, and the
second in coastal central Queensland (Everist 1981).
According to Everist there is no positive evidence of toxicity for either A. americana or A. sisalina apart
from reports of persistently painful skin wounds in people caused by the leaf tips. Blood and Studdert
(1988) state that A. americana contains a toxic saponin and can cause poisoning. Regarding A. lechequilla ,
they say it contains an exogenous photodynamic agent and causes dermatitis but without signs of liver
damage. The MVM records A. lechequilla as containing an unidentified hepatotoxin (causing
photosensitivity) and a toxic saponin with an abortifacient action. (Camp et al (1988) state that the toxin has
been identified as a steroidal saponin, similar to those identified in Panicum spp, and responsible for
hepatogenous photosensitisation). Sheep, cattle and goats are affected, usually during drought. The course
is subacute with signs such as listlessness, inappetance, icterus, yellow oculonasal discharge,
photosensitisation, coma and death occurring.
Ross McKenzie (Principal Veterinary Pathologist, Animal Health Laboratories, DPI, Yeerongpilly, Qld.
advises us that he has one case of suspected A. americana on file. This involved 7 out of 100 cattle ""on the
road"" at Roma during a drought in December 1991. Stiffness, abnormal gait and tucking of the hindlegs
under the body were observed. All affected animals recovered. Clinical pathology revealed markedly
elevated CK and AST. Ross adds that Steyne (1950) produced paralysis of the hindquarters in a rabbit with
100ml of A. americana juice twice daily for 3 days. After no improvement on day 6, the rabbit was killed
and necropsied, the findings being gastric hyperaemia and a pale liver, Ross McKenzie further informs us
that Watt and Breyer-Brandwijk (1962) make reference to Steyne producing bloat, cyanosis, dyspnoea and
tachycardia in sheep using A. americana. Leaf extracts are apparently used in folk medicine in Africa as
purgatives and diuretics.
It appears likely then that, when consumed in sufficient quantities, Agave americana can cause poisoning in
cattle and other animals, this toxicity presumably manifesting itself as a myopathy and mainly affecting the
hindlimbs. Most cases seem to recover."
Calves with Spongy Brains,"Shaun Slatterv, District Veterinarian at Narrabri, investigated an interesting nervous syndrome in week old
“dairy” calves at Pilliga. The cattle are a mixture of Jersey and Guernsey with a fair degree of “line”
breeding. Over the last 3 years the owner has had a dozen out of 40 or so calves die from a nervous
syndrome. Cases occur in winter-spring. Calves are usually 7-10 days when first showing nervous signs
and die usually within 2-4 days. Signs include proprioceptive defects with forelimb hypermetria (""goose-
stepping"") and constant head nodding. Withdrawal (front and back legs) and menace reflexes were absent; a
patella reflex was present.
Haematology and biochemistry (AM94.2463.BV 24.6.94) was unremarkable apart from indications of
dehydration. (Although able to suck, the ataxia and head nodding made this well nigh impossible). The
blood was negative for pestivirus antigen and antibody.
The calf deteriorated and was necropsied. Bochemistry and haematology results (AN94.2505.SL 28.6.94)
were similar to those of a few days earlier. Analysis of the blood indicated the animal was homozygous
normal for maple syrup urine disease. Histologically, severe spongiform changes were evident in the brain
and spinal cord (AN94.2505.SL. We sent histoslides to Dr. Peter Harper, neuropathologist of note and
currently Senior Field Veterinary Officer for NSW Agriculture at Grafton. Peter commented that the
oedematous CNS lesions were among the most widespread he has observed, with severe spongy changes in
both the myelinated areas and in the cerebrocortical grey matter.
Investigations are continuing."
Cholera in turkeys,"A turkey farm in the Tamworth district suffered heavy losses from cholera in August. At the time birds
were submitted to the lab, approximately 10 a day were getting sick and dying in a group of 500 near
marketable birds (22-23 weeks of age). The birds receive a cholera vaccine at 12 and 16 weeks. However,
this vaccine has not been changed for 10 years and the strain of P. multocida isolated at the lab from cases
of cholera in May was not represented in the vaccine. Deaths start about 2 weeks after antimicrobials are
withdrawn from the feed.
Necropsy and histological changes were in keeping with cholera, isolated (heavy pure culture) from various
sites. (AN94.3313.SL)."
"Toxicity due to ""Colleague"" (SmithKline) drench ","In December last year, after the commercial release of the drench ""Colleague"", deaths were reported in
sheep shortly after drenching. Carcasses, tissues and blood samples were sent to the laboratory from 4
separate properties at Armidale, Glen Innes and Uralla. These samples were from lambs but deaths were
also recorded in adult sheep.
Property 3, 55 weaners died out of 3026 drenched. 7 ewes died out of 3555 drenched.
Property 4, A total of 39 died out of 1697 drenched with deaths occurring in each mob of 3 mobs
drenched. These mobs were :- 1010 ewes and wethers, 317 hoggets, 370 lambs.
Five lambs were post-mortemed at the lab. Their weights ranged from 9.5-16 kg. From the history there
was no evidence of overdosing, they were dosed at the recommended level of 1ml per 5kg body weight.
The earliest recorded death occurred 4-6 hours after drenching while most deaths occurred within 1-2 days
of drenching. Clinical signs observed included excess salivation, muscle fasciculation, abdominal pain,
bloat, laboured breathing, and diarrhoea. Post-mortem findings included vascular congestion of the lungs
with froth in the trachea, and vascular congestion of the small intestine. These changes were not found
17.
consistently in all carcasses. Histopathological changes were non-specific and included vascular congestion
and oedema in the lungs and vascular congestion in the liver. Two lambs from one property had evidence
of acute myocardial and hepatic necrosis.
Haematological changes included elevated haematocrit and plasma protein consistent with dehydration and
elevated muscle enzymes including CPK, LDH AND SGOT, which may have been related to the muscle
fasciculation observed. GSHPX levels were measured from single blood samples from 2 separate properties
and were 42 and 113 U/gHb respectively. Brain and blood samples were sent to Macquarie Vetnostic
Services, Leichardt 2040 for measurement of cholinesterase levels. These were :-
BRAIN Animal 1, 0.01 IU/kg
“ Animal 2, 0.008 IU/kg
“ Animal 3, 0.03 IU/kg
NORMAL BRAIN Approx.0.22 IU/kg
WHOLE BLOOD Animal 3, 0.34 IU/I
NORMAL BLOOD Approx. 0.4 IU/I
These low cholinesterase levels are consistent with organophosphate toxicity. The cholinesterase levels in
brain tissue are the most reliable measure of organophosphate toxicity. The organophosphate component,
Pyraclofos, was known before clearance to be potentially toxic under some circumstances, particularly with
liver damage.
The product was commercially released in December 1993 and by 6th January 1994 SmithKline Beecham
had identified 409 deaths Australia-wide from 96,000 doses used on 37 farms. The product has been
withdrawn from the market pending further investigations."
Lamb deaths caused by penetration of oesophageal wall by slow release capsules,"One week after the administration of ""Proftril"" slow release anthelmintic capsules to 2700 lambs, 20-30
lambs had died and another 30 were ill. Three live lambs were submitted for clinical and post-mortem
examination. Clinically they showed slobbering, nasal discharge depression and stiff gait. In all 3 lambs the
capsule had ruptured the oesophagus at the back of the pharynx with the capsule completely penetrating
and passing through the wall of the oesophagus into the neck tissue behind the oesophagus. This was
associated with a severe cellulitis and in all 3 cases food material had passed through the rupture in the
oesophageal wall into the surrounding tissue. The oesophageal walls in these 3 lambs appeared to be quite
fragile and could be easily ruptured with a finger. These lambs' weights ranged from 15-18 kg just below
the recommended cut-off of 20kg."
Thyroid insufficiency in a stillborn Anglo Nubian kid ,"Three stillborn kids from one property were sent to the laboratory for post-mortem examination. Their
weights were 3.8, 4.5 and 4.25kg respectively and the postmortem findings suggested the deaths were
attributed to difficulties at birth with the first 2 showing marked oedema of the head most likely resulting
from dystocia and the 3rd kid being a twin may have died from asphyxiation. The first kid examined had
partial alopecia along the back and the back of the neck. The thyroid glands could not be found at post-
mortem examination and serum collected from heart blood indicated hypothyroidism. From the 2
subsequent kids, both with normal hair growth, the thyroids were grossly and histologically normal. Serum
samples from the affected kid's dam, a second stillborn kid (without alopecia} and it's dam indicated
normal thyroid activity.
18.

TSH (Thyroid stimulating hormone) is a pituitary hormone which increases in a situation of thyroid
insufficiency. Elevation of this hormone level is the best indication of insufficiency and was markedly
elevated in the affected kid. Free T4 (Thyroxine) also indicates thyroid function and in the case of the
affected kid T4 was not detectable. TSH and T4 tests were done by New England Pathology."
Suspect Pithomyces chartarum toxicity in 2 Murray Grey calves,"Two moribund Murray Grey calves were submitted alive for clinical and post-mortem examination after
another calf had been found dead, but was too decomposed for a post-mortem examination. One calf was
submitted in late March and the second in mid-April. The first calf was approximately 4 months old and the
second 2 to 3 months old and although they had been running with their mothers the stomach contents were
all plant material; grass, and small amounts of mistletoe, bracken and wattle seeds, indicating that these
calves were no longer sucking from their mothers. Both calves appeared to be small for their age.
Clinically they were recumbent, and severely jaundiced. An enlarged liver was easily palpated through the
abdominal wall.
The post-mortem findings were virtually the same for both calves:-
- severe jaundice
- enlarged brown liver
- gall bladder virtually empty
- no evidence of photosensitization, both Murray Greys with well pigmented skin.
The first calf was also anaemic (PCV 10%) and adult Haemonchus were visible in the abomasum
(EPG 3040). The second calf had been drenched (PCV 28%, but with many nucleated red blood cells in
the smear suggesting a previous anaemia) and EPG of 0. This second calf also had very pale intestinal
contents.
Both calves had neutrophilia:-
94/1165TWCC - 14.4 x 10/I
Segmented neutrophils - 11.66 x 10/I
94/1487TWCC -31.2 x 10/l
Segmented neutrophils - 26.8 x 10/I
Urinalysis was similar for both calves, positive for bilirubin but negative for urobilinogen indicating that
there was an obstruction to the flow of bile into the small intestine.
19.
Both calves had elevated serum total bilirubin and AST and the second calf also had elevated GGT.
Calf 1 Calf 2 Normal Values
Total bilirubin 187.2 umol/l 229.7 umol/l <10 umol/l
AST 293 U/I 243 U/I <150 U/I
GGT 32 U/I 267 U/I <70 U/I
Histopathological examination of livers from both calves revealed massive damage to bile ducts, and
canaliculi with ballooned and disrupted epithelial cells with bile accumulated in these structures and within
hepatocytes. There were focal areas of hepatocyte necrosis with an associated neutrophil infiltrate.
This lesion is the same as that caused by the mycotoxin, sporidesmin present in the saprophytic fungus,
Pithomyces chartarum. Sporidesmin is excreted in the bile causing inflammation of the bile ducts and
progressive obliterative cholangiolitis resulting in a slowing down of the rate of bile flow to negligible
levels over a period of about 14 days. In the second calf it was obvious from the paleness of the intestinal
contents that bile was not getting through. The urinalysis results confirmed this.
Sporidesmin toxicity has been reported only very rarely in New England and an investigation of the
paddock failed to reveal the source. One Pithomyces spore was identified on a sample of dead grass but
their was very little dead grass when the paddock was examined in late April. Perhaps there had been large
numbers of spores in March when the toxic insult occurred. The climatic conditions at that time were
suitable for the fungus to proliferate. In New Zealand the disease is common and occurs when pasture is
short and contains recently killed plant material in abundance, and under climatic conditions of warm,
humid weather, which favours a heavy infestation with the fungus. This is most likely to be a problem in
autumn when the summer has been hot and dry, the pasture well eaten back and good rains fall when the
ground is still warm."
An investigation of lamb mortality.,"As part of a one month assignment to the CASRP in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province in north-west China in
May/June this year, severe lamb mortality was investigated at the Nanshan stud farm in the foothills of the
Tienshin mountains.
Nanshan stud farm belongs to the Xinjiang Academy of Animal Science. The sheep, predominantly
Merino, are herded by the local partly-nomadic Kasak people. The 5000 breeding ewes are divided into 17
flocks cared for by separate families.
Average lamb mortality (over 9 years) was 12% but for 1994 mortality was approximately 30%. Lambing
in February and March in sub-zero temperatures, takes place indoors in crowded, contaminated and often
muddy pens. Mismothering and poor milk supplies are common, as is the level of human intervention in
feeding the lambs. At approximately 2 days of age, lambs are separated from their mothers except for
feeding twice per day.
In this environment, it was not surprising to find infectious disease. Clinical and post-mortem signs
included ulcers in the mouth, scabs on the muzzle, proliferative lesions on the gums, pneumonia, pleurisy,
pericarditis, diarrhoea, foci of suppuration and necrosis in the liver. Parapox virus was identified in scabs
by electron microscopy and Fusobacterium necrophorum was isolated from ulcerative lesions of the mouth.
The youngest lamb affected was 7 days old and the oldest over 1 month old.
20.
The sequence of events leading to this unusually high mortality was believed to be as follows :-
i An outbreak of scabby-mouth, spread rapidly because of crowding and contamination of the
environment.
ii Secondary infection, particularly with Fusobacterium necrophorum. This organism is a normal
inhabitant of the gut and is usually present in faeces. It can cause necrotic stomatitis visible as hard
circumscribed swellings covered with necrotic material. The infection may extend systemically to
the lungs, stomach, liver, kidneys or spleen.
Drunken horse grass
The plant Drunken Horse Grass (Achnatherum inebrians) occurs in the grazing pastures of northern and
western China, particularly on degraded soil. It has been observed to be toxic to sheep, goats, cattle and
horses and particularly to animals recently introduced into the area. Clinical signs include incoordination,
gangrene of the extremities during cold weather, and death.
Grass and seeds were sent to the New Zealand Agricultural Research Institute by the CASRP. It was
determined that these specimens were endophyte infected and contained high levels of ergot alkaloids.
Thus the toxicity is most like fescue poisoning. Control measures are being investigated.
The quick detection of the toxic principle exemplifies what can be achieved by cooperation between
international research groups."
Blindness in kangaroo,"Cases of blindness in kangaroos occurred in western NSW and North-western Victoria, mainly in flood
plain and sandhill country along the Murray-Darling river system. The first cases were reported from about
mid-May in NSW and about a month later in Victoria. At the height of the outbreak in July up to 10% of
Western grey kangaroos were thought to be affected, with a lower prevalence (about 1%) in Red kangaroos.
By mid-August few new cases were occurring. In most areas there was ample pasture and no unusual or
predominate weed species were present. Despite the time of year mosquito activity was noted.
Clinically the animals were simply blind, and stumbled into bushes and other objects, especially when
disturbed. Otherwise they were apparently normal, could hear, move and feed freely, and generally
maintained body condition. There were no external signs of eye disease.
Fixed material from animals collected early to mid-outbreak was received through the Wildlife Pathology
Service at Sydney University. Subsequently 10 fresh heads and one sedated blind roo were received at RVL
Menangle at the end of July. Cultures were established for viral examination, and sera stored for future
arboviral analysis. Grossly the retinas of several animals were pale, sometimes apparently detached, and
white foci 1-2mm across were seen in two. Otherwise there were no gross lesions, except for bilateral lens
opacities in one animal.
Eyes and brain from 19 animals (including 4 Red kangaroos) were examined histologically. Eyes from
acute cases had a fairly diffuse, moderate to severe, non-suppurative inflammation of the choroid, often in
association with sloughing of the retina. The retina sometimes appeared normal, sometimes had a mild to
moderate mononuclear cell infiltrate, and sometimes had focal necrosis. There was often an attached mixed
cell inflammatory exudate. Less acute cases were similar, but with less severe chordoiditis, and focal
necrosis, with mineralisation, of the rod and cone basal segments of the retina , and often diffuse atrophy
elsewhere. Chronic cases (those animals collected later in the outbreak, and in poorer condition) usually
21.
had mild to moderate multifocal non-suppurative choroiditis, and atrophy of retina. Where retinal
architecture was reasonably preserved there was an apparent reduction in the number of ganglion cells, and
the surface layer of ganglion cell axons was markedly atrophied, vacuolated or entirely absent. Lesions in
the optic nerves varied from moderate recent to severe old-standing Wallerian degeneration. Often there
was virtually no normal staining myelin left. Some nerves had some associated mild non-suppurative
multifocal inflammation. These lesions continued through the optic chiasm into the optic tracts, but white
matter elsewhere in the brain was unaffected. Several animals had a mild to moderate multifocal non-
suppurative encephalitis, characterised by focal gliosis and some perivascular cuffing. There were no
significant lesions in other tissues .
So far nothing has grown on the viral cultures, although the microscopic findings and epidemiology are
suggestive of an infectious cause. Uveitis, sometimes leading to complete blindness with optic nerve
involvement and retinal detachment, possibly associated with Borrelia burgdorferi has been found in
captive kangaroos at the St Louis zoo in the USA. Silver-stained sections from eyes from our cases were
negative for spirochaetes. The optic nerve lesions are similar to those reported for Stypandra poisoning in
livestock, but the associated choroidal and retinal changes seem unique to this outbreak.
Other causes of apparent blindness in kangaroos that were uncovered during field investigations into this
problem included “lumpy jaw” in euros at Fowler’s gap, possible polioencephalomalacia associated with
clover or medic pastures at Coonabarabran, and blindness associated with ocular discharge, corneal
opacities and emaciation from drought affected areas around Brewarrina and Bourke (possibly nutritional
deficiencies )."
Equine pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis. copper toxicity and haemoglobinuria,"A three year old stock horse trucked from Queensland to Kununurra and yarded in the local dip yards was
seen to have a sudden onset of depression, inappetence and port wine urine. The horse died shortly after.
Histologically the liver was extensively fibrosed with megalocytosis and regenerative nodules. Kidney and
liver copper levels were 4 and 3 times normal limits respectively.
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids associated with copper toxicity and intravascular haemolysis is not commonly
recorded in horses. The horse was provided access to lick blocks containing copper; this presumably had
some role in the pathogenesis of this case."
Lymphosarcoma in a dolphin,"An adult female bottlenosed dolphin was presented for post mortem examination after being found washed
up on a beach south of Perth. Necropsy revealed large multilobular masses on the diaphragmatic surface of
the liver, caudal lung and involving the mesenteric lymph nodes. There was a severe peritonitis with
numerous abdominal abscesses and extensive adhesions involving all organs in the lower abdomen. The
uterus was distended with approximately 1.5 litres of fluid. Histopathology revealed a well differentiated
lymphosarcoma involving the mesenteric lymph nodes with metastases to the liver and large intestine. The
cause of the peritonitis could not be identified. "
Trichostrongylus axei in sheep,"Trichostrongylus axei infection in sheep is extremely rare in our experience, and then only in sheep in close
association with cattle. Within the space of two weeks we had three submissions with T.axei in the
abomasum of sheep. The first case was from a departmental trial and only a few worms were seen. The
next two were case submissions from private practitioners:
Case 1 -
Hoggets scouring since early winter. Drenched and improved but scouring again in early October. No
summer drench had been given.
Total Worm Counts
A. total 4150 including 1020 T.axei, 2340 L4 and 740 immatures.
B. total 59760 including 10,515 T.axei, 43110 L4's and 6135 immatures.
Case 2 -
Two year old wethers scouring.
Total Worm counts
A. total 110 including 660 T.axei, 400 L4's and 50 immatures.
B. total 12280 including 10880 T.axei, 900 ostertagia, 200 L4's and 300 immatures.
23.
In these cases, neither property had any cattle on the place for over ten years. In case 1, the sheep came
from a closed flock where only rams were bought. In case two, sheep were bought and sold regularly. Both
properties are in wheatbelt areas which had dry summers and less than average rainfall over winter and
spring."
Osteoporosis associated with low liver copper and high iron levels in lambs,"Lameness was noticed in a flock of lambs at the Mount Barker Research Station 50km north of Albany.
Five lambs were necropsied; one had a fractured femur, all had very fragile bones and two had healing rib
fractures. Apart from this, they all had score 2 footrot lesions and one had focal areas of myocardial
necrosis. All had very low plasma glutathione peroxidase levels and liver selenium levels. All had low liver
copper levels (3,5,6,7,and 7mg/kg) and high liver iron levels (2421-4120mg/kg). Rib ash content varied
from 45.2-49.2%, rib Phosphorous 8.2-8.8% and rib Calcium 17-18.5%. Pasture copper levels were within
our normal ranges (5.8-6.9mg/kg) and molybdenum (1.5-1.6mg/kg) and sulphur (0.34-0.32%db) levels
were also judged to be OK. Pasture iron levels appeared high at 2900-3000mg/kg, in fact so high we are
wondering if the samples were contaminated somehow.
Possible causes of osteoporosis include poor nutrition and milk intake but the ewes in this case were
reported to be in good condition and this must be one of the few parts of the country enjoying a good
season. Heavy intestinal parasitism is also reported to cause osteoporosis and these lambs had reasonably
high parasite burdens but not more than other flocks in the district with none of these bony problems.
Could the low copper levels in these lambs have been induced by high iron intake? Experimentally high
iron intake in cattle can induce low liver copper levels but does not result in lesions of copper deficiency .
Could this be a case of copper deficiency induced osteoporosis? It seems unlikely as no other signs of
copper deficiency were seen but otherwise, we haven’t got a diagnosis."
Septicaemic pasteurellosis in pet rabbits,"Two large white rabbits were necropsied. They were the 3rd and 4th rabbits to die in five days from a group
of six. . There were neither recent introductions nor any history of respiratory disease. The owner had found
the first two dead and the third showing signs of “stiffness with its eyes rolling back in its head”. The fourth
rabbit was also found dead. At necropsy both were extremely fat. The only lesions were multiple pinpoint
white foci distributed throughout the liver. Histologically, these were focal areas of necrosis surrounded by
polymorph infiltrates. Bacterial colonies could be seen in the sinusoids. We grew a pure growth of
Pasteurella multocida from liver, lung and kidney of one rabbit and the liver of the other. In a 1993 report
on diseases in commercial rabbits in Western Australia, Trott cites Pasteurella multocida as a cause of
upper and lower respiratory tract infections, body abscesses, middle ear infections and mastitis/metritis."
Avulsion of Femoral and Humeral Tuberosities in Chickens,"Four caged layer hens were submitted to the laboratory for post mortem examination. There had been a
recent drop in production by about 8% and a 20% increase in the prevalence of thin shells. A similar type
of problem earlier in the year apparently had responded favourably to vitamin/mineral supplementation (no
details given). Some hens were described as having ""the wing joints appear necrotic"".
On examination in the laboratory the hens were in excellent condition and had extensive purplish and green
discolouration of tissues around the scapulo-humeral and femoro-tibial joints, a consequence of
periarticular haemorrhage and subsequent degradation of extravasated blood. At necropsy the haemorrhage
was found to be due to avulsion of the proximal tuberosities of the humeri and lateral condyles of the
femurs, points for insertion of the great flight muscles and massive thigh muscles, respectively. In one case
the entire distal end of the femur had separated from the shaft.
The history of increased prevalence of thin-shelled eggs and the multiple skeletal fractures point fairly
compellingly to a vitamin/mineral deficiency or imbalance. Alas, we did not get any follow-up on
epidemiological details or nutritional history."
Johne's Disease in the Northern Territory ,"A presumptive diagnosis of Johne's Disease (JD), in a cow from a dairy in Katherine, was arrived at after
serological and histopathological examinations. The animal’s serum was reactive in both the CFT and
ELISA (CSL) and the intestinal lesion was typical with many acid fast bacilli present. The diagnosis was
confirmed when VIAS reported a positive radiometric culture of post mortem tissues. The post mortem had
been performed by a local private practitioner.
The cow originally came from either Victoria or New South Wales. The NT has now lost its JD-free status
and CFT testing for JD of breeders destined for export has been re-introduced. In a mob of 417 breeders for
export from a station in the Tennant Creek district 48 (11.5%) reacted in the CFT. Three of these (strong
reactors in both the CFT and ELISA) were slaughtered. There were no gross or histological lesions
suggestive of JD. Culture [now performed at the Berrimah Veterinary Laboratory (BVL)] of faeces and
tissues is still in progress. The cattle had been grazing the ""lakes paddock"" and it is tempting to speculate
that the serological tests were detecting antibodies to avian mycobacteria. Trace forward from the
Katherine dairy has so far failed to detect spread of the disease"
Disseminated Haemangiosarcoma in a Dog,"It is nice to find textbook (Moulton in this case) examples of disease when performing a post mortem
examination in front of veterinary students on work experience.
Necropsy of a dog is a rare occurrence at BVL. On this occasion the owner was worried because an
apparently healthy dog was found dead in the morning. The animal was in good nutritional condition. Six
red tumours from mm to cm size were detected in the skin. In-situ examination revealed haemopericardium
and red tumours in many organs and tissues.
25.
The spleen had multiple tumours from mm to 8cm in diameter. The mesentery was affected and the
tumours were mainly located near the intestines. The intestinal wall itself was also affected. There were
multiple small (mm to cm) tumours in the lung and there was one large (8cm) tumour in the wall of the left
atrium. The epicardium overlying this tumour appeared torn suggesting a rupture causing the
haemopericardium which was considered to be the immediate cause of death. There were a few heartworms
in the right pulmonary artery.
Microscopic examination revealed that the tumours were indeed haemangiosarcomas. In many tissues there
was involvement of blood vessels suggesting haematogenous spread."
Crocodile Crawlers ,"A wild saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) had been kept on a commercial crocodile farm, but had
not thrived. During slaughter, worms were reported to have crawled out of its mouth, much to the disgust of
the female packer. An examination of the worms showed that they were Geoeltascaris australiensis.
Further examination of the stomach contents revealed about 20 adult nematodes.
In two other recent submissions of healthy saltwater crocodiles from the wild, Geoeltascaris were found in
the stomach and appeared to be the cause of deep ulcerations in the stomach wall. Ulcers were up to 4cm in
diameter and appeared to contain a plug of material which was composed of nematodes, cellular debris and
exudate. Up to 50 nematodes were found in one plug. Plugs of similar material were also free in the
stomach contents. The effects of these nematodes on the health of the crocodile are not clear."
Arbovirus Monitoring in the Northern Territory in 1994 ,"Weekly blood sampling for virus isolation was made at Coastal Plains Research Station throughout the
year. The sentinel herd was changed in July to increase the chance of virus isolation during the early wet
season and this has proved successful, with virus activity being detected following the first rains in
October.
Bluetongue serotype 1 was isolated from January to June and Bluetongue serotype 21 in May to June. This
is the first isolation of BLU 21 since 1984. EHD 5 and EHD 1 were also isolated during this period.
Serology on the other sentinel herds confirmed that Bluetongue activity was restricted to the top part of the
Northern Territory.
Apart form Bovine Ephemeral Fever, arbovrius activity was very low throughout the NT due to drought
conditions. There was widespread BEF activity throughout the NT during the wet season. Seroconversions
occurred at all sentinel sites except Alice Springs, with clinical cases reported from as far south as Tennant
Creek and the Barkly Tablelands. One group of export steers had 150 head rejected for export due to BEF.
This year an entomology program has been run in association with sentinel herds. None of the important
Bluetongue vectors were found at Alice Springs or Victoria River Research Station during the year.
Culicoides brevitarsis was only at Katherine with C. brevitarsus and C. actoni at Douglas Daly Research
Farm. C. brevitarsus, C. actoniand C. wadai were identified at Berrimah, while all vectors were present at
the Coastal Plains in all months with C. fulvus the dominant vector species during the wet season and C.
brevitarsus during the dry season."
