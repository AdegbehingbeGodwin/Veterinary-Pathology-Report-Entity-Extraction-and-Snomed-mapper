The clear skies and lighter than usual winds resulted in warmer than normal day\\r\\ntemperatures and very cold overnight minimums, with minus 10.2\\u00b0C being recorded one day in East\\r\\nArmidale.\\r\\nPredictably the weather conditions pedisposed pregnant and post-partum ewes and cows to metabolic\\r\\ndiseases such as pregnancy toxaemia (with losses up to 10% in some flocks) and hypocalcaemia and this\\r\\nwas reflected in submissions to the lab.\\r\\nThere have been reports of small losses due to enterotoxaemia in sheep on grain diets, especially in lot\\r\\nfeeding situations. Grain poisoning has also been encountered. In one case, sheep on one brand of pellet\\r\\nsuffered severe acidosis when a new batch was used. Sixteen died and up to 30% were sick out of a mob of\\r\\n1200 ewes.\\r\\nThe drought has also resulted in more submissions and enquiries relating to plant poisoning, particularly in\\r\\nthe north west slopes and plains of NSW. Shaun Slattery, District Veterinarian at Narrabri, has seen a\\r\\nnumber of cases of \\\"Mother of Millions\\\" (Bryophylum sp) in cattle and also suspected Quinine Bush\\r\\npoisoning. There have been reports of rock fern poisoning in cattle also. Bill Hetherington (DV Moree) has\\r\\nhad his share of suspected plant poisonings as well. One case (AN94.3023.SL) involved 12 deaths in a\\r\\nmob of 170 cattle at Gravesend on drought affected \\\"pasture\\\". Tree Tobacco (Nicotiana glauca) was the\\r\\nmain suspect and the cattle had been eating this as well as a variety of other plants, including Narrow Leaf\\r\\nCotton Bush (Gomphocarpus fruticosus). In South Africa, ostriches are reportedly the animal most\\r\\ncommonly poisoned by N glauca.\\r\\nOf interest also have been cases of suspected \\\"Agave\\\" poisoning in cattle.\",\n          \"Trichostrongylus axei infection in sheep is extremely rare in our experience, and then only in sheep in close\\r\\nassociation with cattle. Within the space of two weeks we had three submissions with T.axei in the\\r\\nabomasum of sheep. The first case was from a departmental trial and only a few worms were seen. The\\r\\nnext two were case submissions from private practitioners:\\r\\nCase 1 -\\r\\nHoggets scouring since early winter. Drenched and improved but scouring again in early October. No\\r\\nsummer drench had been given.\\r\\nTotal Worm Counts\\r\\nA. total 4150 including 1020 T.axei, 2340 L4 and 740 immatures.\\r\\nB. total 59760 including 10,515 T.axei, 43110 L4's and 6135 immatures.\\r\\nCase 2 -\\r\\nTwo year old wethers scouring.\\r\\nTotal Worm counts\\r\\nA. total 110 including 660 T.axei, 400 L4's and 50 immatures.\\r\\nB. total 12280 including 10880 T.axei, 900 ostertagia, 200 L4's and 300 immatures.\\r\\n23.\\r\\nIn these cases, neither property had any cattle on the place for over ten years. In case 1, the sheep came\\r\\nfrom a closed flock where only rams were bought. In case two, sheep were bought and sold regularly. Both\\r\\nproperties are in wheatbelt areas which had dry summers and less than average rainfall over winter and\\r\\nspring.\",\n          \"Formalin fixed tissues were submitted from a 13 week old piglet which was euthanased following ill thrift\\r\\nand inco-ordination affecting all four limbs. At post mortem there were large numbers of Ascaris worms in\\r\\nthe small intestine. Histologic examination of the spinal cord revealed extensive multifocal haemorrhages\\r\\nin the ventral horn of the grey matter, surrounded by macrophages and a few eosinophils. Many large\\r\\nneurons were necrotic. In the white matter there was axonal swelling and Wallerian degeneration especially\\r\\n14.\\r\\nin areas close to the grey matter. In the liver there were multifocal granulomas with eosinophils. Lung was\\r\\nnot submitted.\\r\\nA diagnosis of possible \\\"visceral larva migrans\\\" was made.\\r\\nInternal parasitism caused by Ascaris suis is rarely seen today. The ingested eggs hatch in the intestine,\\r\\nlarvae reach the liver through the hepatoportal blood stream, and are carried by the blood to the lungs. Most\\r\\nof the larvae are arrested in the capillaries in the lungs but some may pass through into the arterial\\r\\ncirculation and reach other organs where extensive migration may occur.\\r\\nThe piggery is semi-intensive, sows farrow in the paddock and weaners are brought into the shed at 6\\r\\nweeks. Deaths have occurred sporadically since weaning; clinical signs included lethargy and progressive\\r\\nweight loss over a number of weeks. The weaners were drenched several times with Nilverm. Re-\\r\\ninfestation, faulty drenching or drench resistance is being investigated.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
